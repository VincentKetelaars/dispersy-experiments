"""
This module provides the Authentication policy.

Each Dispersy message that is send has an Authentication policy associated to it.  This policy
dictates how the message is authenticated, i.e. how the message is associated to the sender or
creator of this message.

    indicates the creator of the message.  This identifier can be either the public key or the sha1
    digest of the public key.  The former is relatively large but uniquely identifies the member,
    while the latter is relatively small but might not uniquely identify the member, although, this
    will uniquely identify the member when combined with the signature.

    Furthermore, a signature over the entire message is appended to ensure that no one else can
    modify the message or impersonate the creator.  Using the default curve, NID-sect233k1, each
    signature will be 58 bytes long.

    The member-authentication policy is used to sign a message, associating it to a specific member.
    This lies at the foundation of Dispersy where specific members are permitted specific actions.
    Furthermore, permissions can only be obtained by having another member, who is allowed to do so,
    give you this permission in the form of a signed message.

    The DoubleMemberAuthentication policy can be used when a message needs to be signed by two

    A message that uses the double-member-authentication policy is signed by two member.  Similar to
    the member-authentication policy the message contains two identifiers where the first indicates
    the creator and the second indicates the members that added her signature.

    Dispersy is responsible for obtaining the signatures of the different members and handles this
    using the messages dispersy-signature-request and dispersy-signature-response, defined below.
    Creating a double signed message is performed using the following steps: first Alice creates a
    message (M) where M uses the double-member-authentication policy.  At this point M consists of
    the community identifier, the conversion identifier, the message identifier, the member
    identifier for both Alice and Bob, optional resolution information, optional distribution
    information, optional destination information, the message payload, and \0 bytes for the two
    signatures.

    Message M is then wrapped inside a dispersy-signature-request message (R) and send to Bob.  When
    Bob receives this request he can optionally apply changes to M2 and add his signature.  Assuming
    that he does the new message M2, which now includes Bob's signature while Alice's is still \0,
    is wrapped in a dispersy-signature-response message (E) and sent back to Alice.  If Alice agrees
    with the (possible) changes in M2 she can add her own signature and M2 is stored, updated, and
    forwarded to other nodes in the community.
