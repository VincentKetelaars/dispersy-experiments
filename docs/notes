DISPERSY:

Stored messages are sent immediately when a dispersy introduction response is sent. If multiple endpoints have the same peer, 
this will result in duplicate messages sent. Are multiple introduction messages necessary? (NAT problems?) 
Perhaps send puncture requests instead.

MultiEndpoint, at this point, holds all information on downloads in self.downloads. 
The download_impl is stored there as well, giving it a lifetime beyond the swift instance download_impl.
SwiftEndpoints have no access to this information for now.


LIBSWIFT:

AddPeer in content.cpp now connects all sockets to all peers



GENERAL:

Tests are necessary to see if multiple channels really perform better. And if improvements can be made.
