DISPERSY:

Stored messages are sent immediately when a dispersy introduction response is sent. If multiple endpoints have the same peer, 
this will result in duplicate messages sent. Are multiple introduction messages necessary? (NAT problems?) 
Perhaps send puncture requests instead.

Perhaps it would be better to close a SwiftEndpoint cleaner.

Check if get_hash could be more efficient in case the status files are already there.

Hold data on sockets from swift separate

Get roothashes from .mbinmap files if available.. But how would I know the file has not changed since then..? 
Compare last time edited..

LIBSWIFT:

AddPeer in content.cpp now connects all sockets to all peers



GENERAL:

Tests are necessary to see if multiple channels really perform better. And if improvements can be made.
