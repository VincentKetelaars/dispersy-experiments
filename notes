Check whether a port is actually available, for dispersy (and swift), and check the tcp cmd port.
When sending anything over the tcp cmd port, make sure that it is functional.

Stored messages are sent immediately when a dispersy introduction response is sent. If multiple endpoints have the same peer, 
this will result in duplicate messages sent.

Perhaps it would be better to close a SwiftEndpoint cleaner.

Check if get_hash could be more efficient in case the status files are already there.
